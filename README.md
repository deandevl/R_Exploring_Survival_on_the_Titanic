# R_Exploring_Survival_on_the_Titanic
Follows an [article](https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/exploring-survival-on-the-titanic/code) from Kaggle on "Exploring the Titanic with R" by Megan L. Risdal (6 March 2016).

A pdf version the article (*Exploring the Titanic.pdf*) is included in this repository.

The notes, R code, and graphic output were generated via [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) in the form of an R [Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) document. The files **Exploring_Survival_on_the_Titanic-Part 1.html** and **Exploring_Survival_on_the_Titanic-Part 2.html** is the final readable output.

Data for the project consist of two csv files under the data folder: `train_df.csv` and `test_df.csv`.
